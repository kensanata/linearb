# Linear B

This little script turns Latin characters into Linear B, based on some
tables I
found
[on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B#Syllabic_signs).
I'd like it to do some typical transformations one knows from
Hiragana:

Example: I want my input to be "This is a text for Linear B".

But many letters and syllables cannot be written in Linear B. So I
turn it into the following, inspired by Japanese Hiragana: "Disu isu a
tekusutu poru linearu pe".

The script then produces: 𐀇𐀱 𐀂𐀱 𐀀 𐀳𐀓𐀱𐀶 𐀡𐀬 𐀪𐀚𐀀𐀬 𐀟
